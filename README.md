# PokemonTypeScraper

This is a basic Web Scraper which asks for the Pokemon type you want to see as input (e.g. fire) and displays all the Pokemon that have that type. This script utlizes the library BeautifulSoup4 to parse the data easily.

The website I am scraping off of is: https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_National_Pok%C3%A9dex_number
