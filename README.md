# PokemonTypeScraper

This is a basic Web Scraper which asks for the Pokemon type you want to see as input (e.g. fire) and displays all the Pokemon that have that type.

The website I am scraping off of is: https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_National_Pok%C3%A9dex_number
